# InternetArchiveXmlGrabber
Random script that splits InternetArchive's (wii europe) Redump's xml into multiple txt files.

iirc the xmls were grabbed from here: https://archive.org/download/wiieuroperedump3 (& 1, 2), but they seem to not be the same anymore, so they're provided as they don't infringe anything, they're just game names

Prolly made to avoid crashing Synology's Download Station.

URL hardcoded

Note: shouldn't be used as the Internet Archive struggles with bandwidth, use another service like Myrient (which is also way more practical)
